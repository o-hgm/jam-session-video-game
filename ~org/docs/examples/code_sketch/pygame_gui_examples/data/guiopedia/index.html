This is a little test of creating a few hyperlink connected pages that we can display to
the user to give them more information. Maybe it'll have a search bar as well? Oh, hey now it does.
<br><br>
The point is we have multiple pages of text that we load in from files, and then we can navigate between them via links
all inside of a window. Here are a few of them to try clicking on:
<br><br>
 - <a href="cats">Cats</a> - A page all about cats.<br>
 - <a href="gravel">Gravel</a> - Gravel: What is the deal.<br>
